## Welcome to Whisky

We're glad you're here. Here's how to get up and running in a breeze.

1. Download Whisky
    - Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/IsaacMarovitz/Whisky/releases)
2. Move Whisky to your Applications folder
3. Open Whisky
4. Follow on-screen instructions

**Everything is now installed!**

## Making your first bottle

Bottles are the bread and butter of Wine. Bottles are like little Windows filesystems, and they appear on your computer as a normal folder. In a bottle, you'll find programs, registry files, and everything else you need to install and configure your Windows 'machine'. Each bottle is self-contained and will only have the programs you installed in that bottle.

1. Press the plus button in the top right-hand corner
2. Give your bottle a name, and select the Windows version you want
3. Hit `Create` and wait a few seconds. When your bottle is ready, it'll appear in the list on the left-hand side

## Installing your first program

1. Click on the bottle you want to install your program into
2. Press the `Run...` button in the bottom right
3. Navigate to where you have your `exe` or `msi` file in Finder
4. Select the file and press `Open`

Whisky will then open and run the program. It may take a few seconds for the window to appear, so be patient :)

## Configuring your bottle

In the `Config` menu of your bottle, you can adjust a number of parameters, including the Windows version and build the number of your bottle, enable and disable the Metal HUD, configure ESync, and open Wine's many configuration tools like the Control Panel, Registry Editor, and Wine Configuration dialogues.
